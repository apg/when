CHANGELOG
 * 2013 December 12 (v 0.2.1)

   - Attempt to exit with exit status of conditional
   - Merge in an option handling bug (thanks @sshaw!)

 * 2013 December 11 (v 0.2)
 
   - Support "zero" mode, which runs the conditional until it exits with a
     return value of 0.
   - Overhaul of pretty much everything, though cleanup still needs to occur.
 
 * 2013 December 10 (v 0.1)

   - Initial release. Supports "timebomb" mode only which runs the second 
     command only if an alarm goes off before the first command terminates.
   - Allow a custom alarm time to be set.
