       wwhheenn  runs  _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n_a_l every NN _s_e_c_o_n_d_s awaiting for "success." Success
       is defined by whether or not the _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n_a_l is still running  when  it
       is supposed to be run again.

       The _-_n flag allows you to set the interval (in seconds) between succes-
       sive attempts at running the _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n_a_l

       wwhheenn will run until interrupted, or _c_o_m_m_a_n_d completes.

       Note that both _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n_a_l and _c_o_m_m_a_n_d are given to "sh -c" which means
       that you may need to use extra quoting to get the desired effect.

       Note  that  POSIX  option  processing  is used (i.e., option processing
       stops at the first non-option argument).  This means that  flags  after
       _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n_a_l don't get interpreted by wwhheenn itself.
