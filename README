WHEN(1)                                                                WHEN(1)



NAME
       when - repeatedly runs a command, then another when the first succeeds

SYNOPSIS
       when [-n <seconds>] [-t|-z] [-h] [-v] <conditional> <command>

DESCRIPTION
       when  runs  conditional every N seconds awaiting for "success." Success
       is defined in one of two ways. In timebomb mode, -t, success is defined
       by  whether or not the conditional is still running after N seconds (as
       specified by the -n flag). In zero mode, -z, success is  acheived  when
       condtional exits with a return value of 0.

       The  -n flag allows the interval to be set (in seconds) between succes-
       sive attempts at running the conditional

       when will run until interrupted, or command completes.


OPTIONS
       -h     Prints the help message and exits successfully.


       -n seconds
	      Sets the interval for running the conditional to  seconds  time-
	      bomb mode, seconds will need to pass before the conditional suc-
	      ceeds.


       -t     Sets the success mode to timebomb which  succeeds  after  condi-
	      tional has been running for at least seconds


       -v     Prints the version and exits successfully.


       -V     Turns on verbose output. Mostly useful for debugging purposes.


       -z     Sets  the  success mode to zero which succeeds after conditional
	      returns 0 the first time. The conditional is  guaranteed  to  be
	      run at most 1 time every seconds

NOTE
       Note that both conditional and command are given to "sh -c" which means
       that you may need to use extra quoting to get the desired effect.

       Note that POSIX option processing  is  used  (i.e.,  option  processing
       stops  at  the first non-option argument).  This means that flags after
       conditional don't get interpreted by when itself.

EXAMPLES
       TODO more examples needed

       Suppose you have a failing build, xmessage will alert you when it  suc-
       ceeds.

	      when "make" "xmessage 'hurrah, build passed'"

       Or you want to say hello to john when we logs on

	      when "w | grep john" "echo 'hello, john' | write john"
