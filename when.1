.SH NAME
when \- repeatedly runs a command, then another when the first succeeds
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B when
.I [\-n <seconds>] [-h] [-v] <conditional> <command>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR when
runs
.I conditional
every
.B N
.I seconds
awaiting for "success." Success is defined by whether or not the
.I conditional
is still running when it is supposed to be run again.
.PP
The
.I -n
flag allows you to set the interval (in seconds) between successive
attempts at running the
.I conditional
.
.PP
.BR when
will run until interrupted, or
.I command
completes.
.SH NOTE
Note that both
.I conditional
and
.I command
are given to "sh -c"
which means that you may need to use extra quoting to get the desired effect.
.PP
Note that POSIX option processing is used (i.e., option processing stops at
the first non-option argument).  This means that flags after
.I conditional
don't get interpreted by
.BR when
itself.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
.IP
when "long running command that can fail quickly" "echo 'hurray it's working'"
